public class Base2 {

    // Doubly Linked List.
    // Main advantage of Doubly is that on deletion from last time complexity will be O(1).
    // Because in doubly a node also has the address of its previous node.
    // So there is no need of iterating the list to find the last second node.

    // Disadvantage is that now every node has an extra parameter.(Let's say).
    // Doubly will take more space than singly linked list.



    // Circular Linked List.
    // Both singly and doubly can be circular.
    // Last node contains the address of the first node.
    // Assume loop playlist method in a music player.
